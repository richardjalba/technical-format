              <p>The story of The Tiger and the Strawberry is An Old Zen Story that contains multiple life lessons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In hard times, appreciate the good moments</li>
                  <li>Don't let yourself be distracted when your attention is vital</li>
                  <li>Not making a decision is still a decision</li>
                  <li>Maybe whichever fate you choose won't be pretty, but it's still your choice</li>
                  <li>You choose how to help yourself and what you reach for</li>
                </ul>
